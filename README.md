### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Will. I also have a [portfolio website](https://bostwick.dev).

#### âœ¨ Looking for new opportunities âœ¨

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **more about serverless**.

I believe in an open, accessible, performant web, and I want to be a part of it. 

<!-- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **getting fancier with React**. -->

I designed and built [wholepigeon.com](https://wholepigeon.com). You can see the repo [here on GitHub](https://github.com/bost-ty/wholepigeon) as well.

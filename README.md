### Hi!

I've been developing for various platforms for almost 15 years. Lately, I've been using JavaScript (with Node) and Python (with TouchDesigner) to design, implement, and run interactive experiences for live shows viewed by millions.

I'm currently learning the deep cutting-edge of Unreal Engine 5 and its unique ecosystem.

I believe deeply in open source technology and the potential for it to help make lives better and to help make the web and tech more accessible to all.

Talk to you later!

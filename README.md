Hi, I'm Will.

I'm a *Creative Technology Developer*. I use design and engineering to solve people's problems.

I like to talk to users, design playful experiences, do a bit of writing, and leave things better than I found them.

I have a background in creativity & collaboration and a life-long passion for technology. I built my first website in 2003. I built [this website](https://bostwick.dev) in 2025.

## Projects

- Bird Talk
  - A full-stack application for managing livestream interactivity. Simplifies the complicated parts and doesn't break when the show is busy.
  - I spent a lot of time talking to clients, users, and folks learning to use Bird Talk in order to create a fluid and powerful user experience.
- Check out [ff-lucid](https://github.com/bost-ty/ff-lucid), my Firefox port of Daniel Eden's Chrome extension [Lucid](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lucid/achogfadpkcepkepcpegehpiiioihmik).
  - It's a low-key notepad as a New Tab replacement that supports additional user settings, Firefox Sync, and handles well even when your Firefox is configured for security/privacy. I'm pretty proud of how it came out.
- Dynomix, a vision mixer assistant for vMix and Bitfocus Companion
  - Designed to reduce cognitive overhead for technical directors building their projects, reducing errors and making it easier to get to the interesting stuff. 
- Bird Suite
  - A frontend-based Twitch analytics app that enables event tagging, knows the difference between a "viewer" and a "chatter", and makes it simple to find out what makes people join and watch a Twitch livestream.


A lot of my *really fun and cool* work is client-based and not public, but I hope you'll take a look around my projects/repos and see what looks cool to you.

Cheers,
Will

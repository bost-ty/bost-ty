### Hi there 👋

🌱 I’m currently learning **React + Hooks**

I believe in an open, accessible, performant web, and I want to help out with that.

🔭 I’m currently working on **an updated portfolio website**. Turns out the building is easy if you just pick the technology and get started!

I designed and built [wholepigeon.com](wholpigeon.com). You can see the repo [here on GitHub](https://github.com/bost-ty/wholepigeon) as well.

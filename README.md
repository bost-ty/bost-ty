# Hi, I'm Will. 

I'm a developer with a cross-disciplinary background in product, data, interactive media, and how to put them together.

## Technologies

Web platform first when possible; always performant and useful.

- TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Svelte
- HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, shadcn
- Node (Node.js, NodeJS, what's your favorite way to write it?)
- Python for ML, DA, and [live interactive graphics/installations](https://derivative.ca/)

## Projects

If you use Firefox, check out [ff-lucid](https://github.com/bost-ty/ff-lucid), my Firefox port of Daniel Eden's Chrome extension [Lucid](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lucid/achogfadpkcepkepcpegehpiiioihmik). It's a low-key notepad as a New Tab replacement that supports additional user settings, Firefox Sync, and handles well even when your Firefox is configured for security/privacy. I'm pretty proud of how it came out.

A lot of my work is client work and so isn't public on GitHub, but I hope you'll take a look around my open work and see what looks cool to you.

Thanks!

:)

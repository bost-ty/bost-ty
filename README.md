### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Will, a self-taught web developer who loves the internet. I have a shiny [portfolio website](https://bostwick.dev).

#### 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **even more React** (it never ends!).

I believe in an open, accessible, performant web, and I want to be a part of it. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **a small but mighty redesign for my portfolio site**.

I designed and built [wholepigeon.com](https://wholepigeon.com). You can check out the repo [here on GitHub](https://github.com/bost-ty/wholepigeon).

ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm on Twitter as [@bost-ty](https://twitter.com/bost-ty/)

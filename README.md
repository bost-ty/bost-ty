### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught web developer who loves the internet.

I believe in an open, accessible, performant web, and I want to be a part of it. 

I designed and built [wholepigeon.com](https://wholepigeon.com). You can check out the repo [here on GitHub](https://github.com/bost-ty/wholepigeon).

I build things that work with Twitch and live data to make other fun things happen.

# Hi, I'm Will. 

I'm a product-focused engineer with a cross-disciplinary background in design, interactive experiences, and data.

## Technologies

Web platform first when possible; always performant, accessible, and useful.

- TypeScript, JavaScript, Svelte 5, React
- HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS
- WebSockets, Server Sent Events (SSE), OSC, and other  protocols
- Python for ML, DA, and [live interactive graphics/installations](https://derivative.ca/)
- SQLite for smaller deployments

Lately, I've been having a great time using SvelteKit to power apps and APIs.

## Projects

- Check out [ff-lucid](https://github.com/bost-ty/ff-lucid), my Firefox port of Daniel Eden's Chrome extension [Lucid](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lucid/achogfadpkcepkepcpegehpiiioihmik).
  - It's a low-key notepad as a New Tab replacement that supports additional user settings, Firefox Sync, and handles well even when your Firefox is configured for security/privacy. I'm pretty proud of how it came out.
- Dynomix, a vision mixer assistant for vMix and Bitfocus Companion
  - Designed to reduce cognitive overhead for technical directors building their projects, reducing errors and making it easier to get to the interesting stuff. 
- Bird Suite
  - A frontend-based Twitch analytics app that enables event tagging, knows the difference between a "viewer" and a "chatter", and makes it simple to find out what makes people join and watch a Twitch livestream.

A lot of my *really fun* work is client-based and so isn't public on GitHub, but I hope you'll take a look around my projects/repos and see what looks cool to you.

Thanks!

:)

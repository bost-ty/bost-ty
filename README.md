Hi! I'm a developer with a cross-disciplinary background in data, product, front-end, and interactive media.

If you use Firefox, check out `ff-lucid`, my Firefox port of Daniel Eden's Chrome extension `Lucid`. It supports additional user settings, Firefox Sync, and handles Firefox even when configured for extremely high security and privacy.

A lot of my work *isn't* on GitHub because it's, well, for work and I can't share it in public.

:)

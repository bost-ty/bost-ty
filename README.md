### Hi!

I've been developing for various platforms for almost 15 years. Lately, I've been using JavaScript (with Node) and Python (with TouchDesigner) to design, implement, and run interactive experiences for live shows viewed by millions.

I believe deeply in open source and the potential for it to help make lives better.

Talk to you later!

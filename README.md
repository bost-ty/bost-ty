### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **React + Hooks**

I believe in an open, accessible, performant web, and I want to help out with that.

If you're interested, check out this website I designed and built, wholepigeon.com, on [GitHub](https://github.com/bost-ty/wholepigeon) or [live](https://wholepigeon.com). I'm open to feedback, issues, or PRs that make it better! (Or just order some dope custom embroidery -- WP is amazing!)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **an updated portfolio website**. Turns out the building is easy if you just pick the technology and get started!

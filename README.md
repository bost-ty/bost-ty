# Hi, I'm Will. 

I'm a developer with a cross-disciplinary background in data, product, interactive media, and how to put them together.

If you use Firefox, check out `ff-lucid`, my Firefox port of Daniel Eden's Chrome extension `Lucid`. It supports additional user settings, Firefox Sync, and handles Firefox even when configured for extremely high security and privacy. I'm pretty proud of it.

A lot of my work isn't on GitHub because it's for studio clients, but I hope you'll take a look around and talk to me about anything that you find interesting by opening an Issue. I won't mind.

Thanks!

:)

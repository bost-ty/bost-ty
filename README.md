### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### âœ¨ I'm open to employment, collaboration, and new projects! âœ¨

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **more about serverless**.

I believe in an open, accessible, performant web, and I want to help out with that.
The most successful companies invest in people, teams, and processes that enable success. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **an updated portfolio website**. Turns out the building is easy if you just pick the technology and get started!

I designed and built [wholepigeon.com](wholpigeon.com). You can see the repo [here on GitHub](https://github.com/bost-ty/wholepigeon) as well.

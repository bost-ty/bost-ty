# Hi, I'm Will. 

I'm a developer with a cross-disciplinary background in product, data, and interactive experiences.

## Technologies

Web platform first when possible; always performant, accessible, and useful.

- TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Svelte
- HTML, CSS, SCSS, Tailwind, shadcn/radix/Melt
- Node (Node.js, NodeJS, what's your favorite way to write it?)
- WebSockets and other "real-time" protocols
- Python for ML, DA, and [live interactive graphics/installations](https://derivative.ca/)

## Projects

- Check out [ff-lucid](https://github.com/bost-ty/ff-lucid), my Firefox port of Daniel Eden's Chrome extension [Lucid](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lucid/achogfadpkcepkepcpegehpiiioihmik).
  - It's a low-key notepad as a New Tab replacement that supports additional user settings, Firefox Sync, and handles well even when your Firefox is configured for security/privacy. I'm pretty proud of how it came out.
- Dynomix, a vision mixer assistant for vMix and Bitfocus Companion
  - Designed to reduce cognitive overhead for technical directors building their projects, reducing errors and making it easier to get to the interesting stuff. 
- Bird Suite
  - A frontend-based Twitch analytics app that enables event tagging, knows the difference between a "viewer" and a "chatter", and makes it simple to find out what makes people join and watch a Twitch livestream.

A lot of my *really funly* work is client-based and so isn't public on GitHub, but I hope you'll take a look around my projects/repos and see what looks cool to you.

Thanks!

:)
